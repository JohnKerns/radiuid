##########   WHAT IS RADIUID   ##########
-----------------------------------------

RadiUID is a Linux-based application built to take everyday RADIUS accounting information generated by RADIUS authenticators like wireless systems, firewalls, etc (which contain username and IP info) and send that IP and username mapping info to a Palo Alto firewall to be used by the User-ID system in the Palo Alto for user or group-based access-list filtering. 




##########   HOW IT WORKS   ##########
--------------------------------------

RadiUID uses FreeRADIUS as a backend service to listen on RADIUS accounting ports (typically TCP\UDP 1813) and write recieved accounting information to the accounting logs.

RadiUID then parses these logs, pulls down the User and IP mapping information and pushes those mappings to the Palo Alto firewall using the published RESTful XML API.




##########   REQUIREMENTS   ##########
--------------------------------------

Hopefully this list of requirements will expand as development for RadiUID continues; relaxing the specific requirements for the operating system, interpreter version, and PAN-OS software version.

OS:			**CentOS 7 Minimal Install (recommended to update to latest patches)**

Interpreter:		**Python 2.7 (Included in current release of CentOS 7)**

PAN-OS Version:		**6.X and 7.X**




##########   TESTED ENVIRONMENTS   ##########
--------------------------------------

RadiUID has been written and tested in few environments to date as it was purpose-built for a specific environment, but it should be very adaptable as it uses standardized RADIUS accounting to source user information and the published API to push that info to firewalls.

RadiUID has currently been tested with the following RADIUS servers and authenticators

Identity Systems: **JumpCloud RADIUS service, Windows 2012 NPS Server (with Active Directory)**

Authenticators: **Meraki Wireless Access Points, Cisco Wireless (Controller-based)**




##########   INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS   ##########
----------------------------------------------

The install of RadiUID is very quick and straightforward using the built-in installer.

	[1]: Install CentOS 7 Minimal Install with appropriate IP and OS settings


	[2]: Update CentOS 7 to latest patches (recommended)
		> yum update -y

	[3]: Install the Git client (unless you already have the files)
		> yum install git -y

	[4]: Download the RadiUID repo to any location on the box
		> git clone https://github.com/PackeTsar/radiuid.git

	[5]: Change to the directory where the RadiUID main code file (radiuid.py) and config file (radiuid.conf) are stored
		> cd radiuid

	[5.1]: (OPTIONAL) Change to a development branch (perform this step only if you are prepared for a app which is under active development and may have broken features)
		> git checkout dev-X.X.XXX

	[6]: Run the RadiUID program in install mode to perform the install
		> python radiuid.py install

	[7]: Follow the on-screen prompts to install FreeRADIUS and the RadiUID app


	[8]: The installer should let you know if everything installed correctly and services are running, but below are the CLI commands you can run to check up on it.


	[9]: Remember that install mode of RadiUID ('radiuid install') can be used for the initial install and also maintenance of the application:
		-Changing settings in the RadiUID .conf file
		-Changing client settings in FreeRADIUS
		-Checking health of FreeRADIUS and RadiUID services
		----NOTE: Make sure that you have the .conf file in the same directory as the .py directory for the initial install




##########   RADIUID COMMAND INTERFACE   ##########
----------------------------------------------

The RadiUID system is meant to run in the background as a system service: contantly checking for new RADIUS accounting data and pushing User-ID mapping information to the firewall, but it also has an easy to use command interface. This command interface is meant to be used for regular maintenance, troubleshooting, and operation of the system.

Below is the CLI guide for the RadiUID service.

```
